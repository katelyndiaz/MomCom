                    <p>Hi MomCom!</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>I told my doctor about my severe backaches and headaches, and he said it was completely normal. There are times where I can only lie down in a dark room. I know my body, and this isn’t normal, or right. Any suggestions? Am I overreacting?</p>

                    <p>DROP. THAT. DOCTOR. NOW. He is not only not listening to your needs and concerns, but having to lie down in a dark room is NOT NORMAL. Use the connect with other resources panel to find a new doctor! It can even search by insurance, location, and how other WOC felt about their interactions!</p>

                    <p>Echoing the previous poster, what you are experiencing is not normal. I would recommend getting in touch with a different OB/GYN as soon as possible. When you speak with the new doctor, don’t mention what your previous doctor said! If the new doctor agrees with your previous doctor, tell them to put in your chart what your symptoms have been and that they are refusing care. This generally gets them to “reassess” your case.</p>
